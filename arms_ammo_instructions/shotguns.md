### Shotguns
Shotguns use 12-guage ammunition and usually fire buckshot as opposed to a single bullet.
They hurt a lot.
They look a bit like rifles, and often take two hands to fire correctly.
Shotguns fire either buckshot or slugs;
buckshot is a shell full of little metal balls that isn’t as accurate as a
bullet, because the balls will begin to come apart in flight, and shells are
large slugs, designed for hitting things as longer ranges and hurting them more
than a pistol does.
Note that
using slug ammunition in a shotgun increases the range by 5 hexes, and
firing a double shot (both barrels)
decreases range by 3 hexes.
