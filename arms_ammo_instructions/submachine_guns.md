### Submachine Guns
SMGs can fire single shots as well
as bursts of bullets.
Submachine
guns were designed to put the
stopping and suppressive power of early
machine guns like the Gatling gun into
the hands of infantry soldiers. Used as
early as late World War I, submachine
guns soon changed the face or warfare in
the
20th
century.
Happily,
most
submachine guns are small enough to use
as one-handed weapons.
