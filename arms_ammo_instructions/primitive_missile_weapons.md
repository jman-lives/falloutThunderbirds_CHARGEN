### Primitive Missile Weapons
One of the oldest “firearms” is the
bow. Traces of these weapons have
been found among excavations of the
most primitive settlements, and
Neanderthals used them over 30,000 years
ago. The bow family of weapons is
suddenly very popular in a world where
they are easy to make and are better
than a knife or sharpened stick. Bows
all require two hands to use.
Other kinds of primitive missile weapons
are popular among tribals again as well,
as they are far easier to construct and
maintain than 100-year-old firearms.
