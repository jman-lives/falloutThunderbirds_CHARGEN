## Hit Points & Skill Points on Level Up

On gaining a level:

Let:
- `END` = Endurance
- `IN` = Intelligence

### Hit Points Gained

Each level, a character gains:

> HP Gain = 3 + floor(END / 2)

This is added to maximum Hit Points.

### Skill Points Gained

Each level, a character gains:

> SkillPoints = 5 + (2 × IN)

Skill points are then spent on skills according to the Skill Progression table below.

---

## Skill Progression Costs

Not all skills increase at the same rate. The cost in skill points to raise a skill by 1% depends on its current value.

| Current Skill % | SP Cost per +1% |
|----------------:|-----------------|
| 1–100           | 1 SP            |
| 101–125         | 2 SP            |
| 126–150         | 3 SP            |
| 151–175         | 4 SP            |
| 176–200         | 5 SP            |
| 201+            | 6 SP            |

## Implementation Notes

- Perk eligibility must be checked against:
  - Level
  - Attributes
  - Skills
  - Race / type
- Perk ranks must never exceed the listed maximum
- Robots **never** gain perks
- Racial and special restrictions must be strictly enforced
- Effects that alter fundamental rules (like action costs, critical behavior, or XP gain) should be implemented in core logic, not as simple modifiers
