An
explosive
device
consisting
of
several sticks of dynamite, a detonator,
and a timer to set it off.
Setting
dynamite takes a successful roll against
the
Traps
skill;
an
unsuccessful roll means the
timer
was
not
set
correctly, and will not go
off
on
time
(in
other
words, you might not be
able to run fast enough). Dynamite does
1d20+30 points of damage to anything in
its hex and all adjacent hexes when it

damage to anything within 4 hexes of the
explosion.

dangerous.
W: 5 lbs.
### Plastique (C-14 Plastic Explosive)
Value: 400
C-14 is an improved version of the
classic C-4 plastic explosive. A gummy-
like substance that can be rigged to

can be molded to any shape,
to
detonate
in
a
concentrated area or spread
along a wider surface.
C-
14 is a white or gray
substance that looks and
feels a lot like Silly Putty™.
Setting
it takes a successful roll against
Traps; like dynamite, if the roll fails,
the timer is not set correctly, and will
blow at the wrong time, or not at all.
Plastique
does
2d20+30
damage
to
anything within the hex in which it
detonates, half damage to everything in
adjacent
hexes,

computers, ATMs, and pocket calculators.
W: 5 lbs.
## Chems (Drugs)
T
here
are
plenty
of
ways
to
chemically alter one’s body in the
wastes, and not all of them are
entirely beneficial.
Chems always have
some kind of effect on a person.
Sometimes,
a
chem
is
not
easily
identifiable, so when you come across a
big crate of syringes and want to know
what they are, there is no choice but to
shoot one and see what it does.
NOTE:
The creator of this game does not
recommend this course of action in the
real world.
Note: All chems can change a character’s
stats above and below racial limits.
When a drug’s positive effects have worn
off, stats return to normal and are then
effected by the negative effects.
### Jet
Value: 25
Jet is the new street drug of the post-
nuclear world. No one knows exactly how
it was made, except there are rumors
that a mafia boss had it
manufactured
to
aid
in
controlling large numbers of
people.
Considering that Jet
is addictive from the first dose, that
is not difficult to imagine.
Jet comes
in
an
inhaler,
much
like
asthma
medicine.
After inhalation, the user
gains +2 Action Points (up to 13), +1
Strength, and +1 Perception for 1d10
hours.
After this time, the character
loses two Action Points, 3 Strength, and
3 Perception.
Jet is 80% addictive,
although it is rumored that an antidote
exists for the addiction – somewhere.
### Healing Powder
Value: 50
This is a simple healing powder
that, when ingested, helps ease
pain from minor wounds. It heals
1d10+5 HP when eaten, and causes
the user to lose 1 Perception for 1 hour
after consumption.
Not addictive.
negative effects of this powder
cumulative.
The
are
Stimpak
Value: 150
Stimpaks are small syringes with healing
chems that ease pain and encourage
cellular mitosis, helping
cells restore themselves at
an increased rate.
Quite
common before the war, they
can be found, in one form
or another, almost everywhere.
When
injected, the stimpak heals 1d10+10 HP.
Not addictive.
### Voodoo
Value: 50
A tribal concoction made from parts of
dead critters (yummy!)
Eating this
powder makes someone feel invincible.
For 30 minutes, Voodoo confers a +2
bonus to Agility, a +3 bonus to Luck,
and a 20% bonus to Damage Resistance for
Normal attacks only. After a half-hour,
the user feels depressed and loses 2
Agility,
3
Luck,
and
all
Damage
Resistance from Normal attacks.
Voodoo
is 20% addictive.
### Antidote
Value: 150
Made from a variety of distilled poisons
and antibodies, each dose of Antidote
removes
one
level
of
poisoning.
Antidote tastes
and looks like cough syrup,
and
comes
in
little
bottles.
There
is
no
official Antidote company in the wastes,
and it is often something that country
doctors and traveling quacks will sell
for far more than it’s worth.
Not
addictive.
### Buffout
Value: 200
Buffout
is
a
kind
of
temporary
steroid,
increasing
mitochondrial
activity in muscles for a
brief
period
of
time.
Unfortunately,
these
same
chemicals also impair brain function.
Taking this drug is fine so long as you
are about to slug it out in a boxing
ring, but not recommended for operating
a tank in combat.
When swallowed,
Buffout increases the user’s Strength by
2, Agility by 2, and Endurance by 3.
The effects last one-half (round down)
112of 1d10 hours.
After the effects wear
off, the user loses 3 Strength, 3
Agility, and 2 Endurance for 1d10 hours.
Buffout
carries
a
30%
chance
of
addiction.
### Mentats
Value: 280
Mentats increase the user’s awareness
for a short period of time, but are
dangerous
because
of
the
intense
aftereffects
and
high
addiction
rate.
An
experimental drug for the
military at one time, these
pills became popular in the prewar
streets because of the intense high.
When Mentats are swallowed, the user’s
Perception increases by 2, Intelligence
increases by 2, and Charisma increases
by 1 (everyone’s more attractive when
under the influence!). The effects last
1 hour, after which time the user’s
Perception
and
Intelligence
are
decreased by 4 and Charisma is decreased
by 3 for 1d10 hours. Mentats have a 60%
chance of addiction.
### After Burner Gum
Value: 350
After Burner was an attempt to legalize
a “safe” form of meth in the early 21st
century.
Tiny methamphetamine crystals
were mixed in with chewing gum by some
enterprising corporation.
The result
was a moderate dose of the drug that
lasted for only a few minutes, but
produced an intense high in that time.
Chewing After Burner gives the user a +1
bonus to Strength and Perception, and
raises the user’s Action Points by 2,
for 1d10 minutes.
After that time, the
user loses 1 point of Strength and 2
points of Perception for 1 hour.
After
Burner is 30% addictive.
### Psycho
Value: 400
Psycho is a drug that is much like a
combination between Mentats and speed.
This
chemical
cocktail
is
highly
addictive and has horrible
side effects, but the high it
produces is worth it to many
users.
After
injecting
Psycho, the user’s Agility
increases by 3, and their Intelligence
is reduced by 3. The effects of Psycho
last 1d10 hours, after which time the
user loses 3 points to ALL Stats except
Luck for 1d10 hours.
Psycho is 50%
addictive.
### Super Stimpak
Value: 500
This is an incredible melange of healing
chems
designed
to
aid
wounded
soldiers
on
the
battlefield
in
crucial
moments of combat.
Super
stimpaks come in a large
clamp that fit around the arm and inject
the chemicals into the user at various
times, maximizing the effects of the
chemicals.
The whole injection process
still takes less than a second.
Super
stimpaks heal 5d10+50 HP, but the user
loses 1d10 HP after an hour from the
aftershock.
It is a good idea to get
some other form of healing should the
user’s HP drop to dangerous levels
again. Not addictive.
### Brotherhood of Steel Trauma Pack
Value: 600
A
chemical
concoction
made
by
the
Brotherhood for use in battle, Trauma
Packs send the cellular reproduction
process into overdrive, healing 6d10+60
hit
points
instantly,
but
causing
2d10+30 points of damage after 1 hour.
Not addictive.
### Mutie
Value: 700
Mutie is a chemical that reproduces the
effects of the Forced Evolutionary Virus
for a short time.
After injecting this
drug, the user gains +4 to Strength, + 4
to Perception, -4 to Charisma, and –4 to
Intelligence for 1d10 hours. After that
time, the user must make a successful
roll against Endurance; if the roll
fails, they take 4d10 points of damage.
Note that super-mutants will experience
no effects from taking Mutie.
Mutie is
20% addictive.
### Ultra Stimpack
Value: 1000
The most powerful healing substance on
the
planet,
Ultra
Stimpacks
turn
cellular reproduction into a frenzy of
activity,
healing
10d10+50
HP
immediately upon injection.
In 1d10
hours, the user must make a roll against
Endurance.
If that roll fails, they
lose every hit point the Ultra Stimpack
healed; if the roll succeeds, the user
loses half of those hit points.
Ultra
Stimpacks
are
only
available
in
technology-rich organizations like the
Brotherhood of Steel or the Enclave.
### Radaway
Value: 1500
Radaway, an obscure drug from prewar
times, became one of the most useful
after the bombs went off.
It comes in an IV bag and
must be taken through a
drip IV over the period of
about an hour. The Radaway
works in the user’s system to bond with
radioactive particles and wash them out.
1 day after use, the user loses 25 rads.
2 days after use, the user loses another
25 rads. Radaway, unfortunately, has an
addiction rate of 20%.
### Rad-X
Value: 2000
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound
of cure, and that was the idea behind
these drugs.
Although they were never
marketed for consumer use
before the war, enough were
made for militaries so that
they are not unknown in the
postwar world.
Rad-X is a
pill that increases the user’s Radiation
Resistance by 50% for 1d10 hours after
ingestion
by
creating
a
kind
of
radiation “anti-body” in the user.
Not
addictive.
