# Fallout: Thunderbirds — Primary Attributes

This document defines the Primary Statistics (attributes) used during character creation.

Primary Statistics influence Secondary Statistics and are sometimes rolled against to determine outcomes during play (such as noticing details, resisting hazards, or performing feats).

---

## Primary Statistics Overview

All characters begin play with **average attributes**:

- Each Primary Statistic starts at **5**

The player then has **5 Character Points** to distribute among the Primary Statistics.

### Character Point Rules

- Points may be added to or subtracted from any statistic.
- Points subtracted from one statistic must be added to another (no points may be lost).
- Statistics may **never** go below racial minimums.
- Statistics may **never** exceed racial maximums.
- If a statistic must be adjusted to stay within racial limits, excess points must be redistributed elsewhere.

### Traits and Attributes

- Traits that modify statistics are applied **after** Character Points are assigned.
- Traits cannot normally raise a statistic above racial maximums or lower it below racial minimums.
- Players should avoid allocating points in ways that will be nullified by trait restrictions.

## Example: Assigning Primary Statistics

### Example 1: Jack’s Character (Mutant Fighter)

Jack wants to create a hand-to-hand fighting character. He chooses:

- **Race:** Mutant  
- **Trait:** Heavy Handed  

Jack begins with baseline attributes:

STR 5 | PE 5 | EN 5 | CH 5 | IN 5 | AG 5 | LK 5

Jack believes a fighter should be strong and agile, so he allocates:

- +2 STR
- +3 AG

New values:

STR 7 | PE 5 | EN 5 | CH 5 | IN 5 | AG 8 | LK 5

Jack then decides Charisma is less important than Luck:

- −1 CH
- +1 LK

Final attributes:

STR 7 | PE 5 | EN 5 | CH 4 | IN 5 | AG 8 | LK 6

All values fall within Mutant racial limits, so no further adjustments are required.

### Example 2: Jane’s Character (Human Diplomat)

Jane wants a character who can talk her way out of trouble. She chooses:

- **Race:** Human  
- **Trait:** Sex Appeal  

Jane allocates her points as follows:

- +2 CH
- +2 IN
- +1 PE

Resulting attributes:

STR 5 | PE 6 | EN 5 | CH 7 | IN 7 | AG 5 | LK 5

She decides physical strength is less important:

- −1 STR
- −1 EN
- +2 LK

Final attributes:

STR 4 | PE 6 | EN 4 | CH 7 | IN 7 | AG 5 | LK 7

Jane has created a fast-talking, perceptive character well within Human racial limits.

## Primary Statistics: Descriptions

### Strength (STR)

Strength measures a character’s physical power and muscle mass.

- Affects **Carry Weight**, **Melee Damage**, and **Hit Points**
- Determines minimum Strength requirements for weapons
- Used for feats of raw power such as breaking doors or bending bars

High-Strength characters hit hard and carry more; low-Strength characters struggle with physical tasks.

---

### Perception (PE)

Perception represents awareness, instincts, and street-smarts.

- Determines **Sequence**
- Influences skills such as Lockpick, Traps, First Aid, and Doctor
- Determines maximum effective range for ranged weapons

High Perception characters notice subtle details and excel as snipers or investigators. Low Perception characters miss obvious clues.

---

### Endurance (EN)

Endurance measures health, stamina, and physical resilience.

- Determines **Hit Points**, **Poison Resistance**, **Radiation Resistance**, and **Healing Rate**
- Modifies the Outdoorsman skill
- Used to resist knockdowns, unconsciousness, and environmental hazards

High-Endurance characters are tough and resilient; low-Endurance characters tire easily and fall ill quickly.

---

### Charisma (CH)

Charisma measures physical attractiveness, social grace, and leadership ability.

- No Secondary Statistics are directly based on Charisma
- Strongly influences **Barter** and **Speech** skills
- Used in social interactions such as persuasion, deception, and charm

Charismatic characters naturally attract followers; uncharismatic characters struggle socially.

---

### Intelligence (IN)

Intelligence reflects reasoning ability, memory, and problem-solving skills.

- Determines skill point gain per level
- Influences many non-combat skills
- Used to solve puzzles, recognize patterns, or deduce information

High-Intelligence characters think their way through problems; low-Intelligence characters rely on instinct or luck.

---

### Agility (AG)

Agility measures reflex speed and coordination.

- Determines **Armor Class** and **Action Points**
- Influences most combat skills
- Used for dodging, quick reactions, and precise movements

High-Agility characters are fast and evasive; low-Agility characters are clumsy and slow to react.

---

### Luck (LK)

Luck represents chance, fate, and improbable fortune.

- Determines **Critical Chance**
- Influences the Gambling skill
- Used at the GM’s discretion to resolve improbable events

Lucky characters seem blessed by fate; unlucky characters always seem to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

## Design Notes

- Primary Statistics are the foundation of all derived mechanics.
- Attribute changes should immediately trigger recalculation of all dependent Secondary Statistics.
- Racial limits and trait effects must always be enforced during character creation.
