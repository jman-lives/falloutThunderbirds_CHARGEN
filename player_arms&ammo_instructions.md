# Part VI: Weapons, Ammunition, Armor, and Equipment,Including Chems and Vehicles
The trade value of each item is given, along with all appropriate information for weapons, ammunition, and armor.
## Weapons
The weapons are broken down by skill required, and then by type of weapon.
Note that guns do damage based on the type of ammunition
being used, and the gun itself may give
a bonus to that damage.
### Weapons Abbreviations:
```
Dmg = Damage (note that damage for guns
is determined by the type of ammunition
used, and any bonuses the gun adds)
S = Single
T = Targeted
B = Burst
Rng = Range in meters. (In standard combat, one hex is 1 meter in diameter. (Numbers in ( ) indicate range with a tripod where applicable.))
W = Weight
MD = Melee Damage
```
### Unarmed Skill Weapons
    This skill covers the good old-fashioned method of beating people up with your bare fists, and weapons that compliment this method.
#### Fists and Feet
Value: N/A
Unless your character is missing a limb
or two, they have these weapons with
them at all times.
The most basic of
weapons.
Min. ST: 1 W: N/A Dmg: 1d4 + MD Rng: 1
AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Brass Knuckles
Value: 40
A device that fits around the knuckles
of a fighter, making punches
hurt
a
lot
more.
It
distributes the force of the
blow
evenly
over
the
puncher’s
hand,
allowing
them to avoid breaking their fingers.
Min. ST: 1 W: 1 lb Dmg: 1d10 + MD Rng: 1
AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Tiger Claw
Value: 75
A glove that fits over a portion of the
knuckles
and
fingers,
concealing sharp “claws”
in the palm.
A simple
weapon,
often
used
for
ritualistic tribal combat
rather than serious fighting. Assassins
like to dip tiger claws in poison to
make an easily concealable – and deadly
– weapon.
Min. ST: 1 W: 1 lb Dmg: 1d2 + MD Rng: 1
AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Sapper
Value: 80
Essentially a normal glove with weights
attached, the sapper is designed to help
you hit harder.
Like a melee sap (see
below), the primary use of this weapon
is to knock an opponent unconscious from
a sneaky blow to the head.
Head shots
with this glove have a 75% chance of
knocking the target unconscious for 1d10
rounds.
Min. ST: 3 W: 4 lbs. Dmg: 1d6 + MD Rng:
1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Shredders
Value: 90
Shredders are gloves that have small,
sharp claws attached to the fingers,
allowing
the
user
to
scratch
an
opponent.
Not very useful as a melee
weapon, but coated with the right kind
of poison, shredders can be extremely
dangerous.
Min. ST: 1 W: 2 lbs. Dmg: 1d4 + MD Rng:
1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Lacerators
Value: 100
This nasty little glove represents some
of the finest innovations raiders and
tribals have made since the war. Gloves
covered with razor blades, lacerators
will rip flesh into fine pieces with a
simple swipe of the hand.
Min. ST: 1 W: 2 lbs. Dmg: (1d8+2) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Mace Glove
Value: 150
The mace glove is a large, weighted,
spiked metal ball attached
to a glove, so the user
can
beat
unsuspecting
critters or raiders with
more
effectiveness.
Certainly not an elegant weapon, but an
efficient one.
Min. ST: 3 W: 5 lbs. Dmg: 1d12 + MD Rng:
1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Spiked Knuckles
Value: 250
An improved version of the classic brass
knuckles, the spiked knuckles do more
damage, tearing into the flesh
of your opponent in unarmed
combat.
Like
the
brass
knuckles, they distribute damage
evenly across the puncher’s fingers.
Min ST: 1 W: 1 lb Dmg: (1d10+4) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Boxing Gloves
Value: 250
One can still find practitioners of "the
sweet science" in the wastes.
If your character is thinking of
becoming the next Balboa, these
are essential.
#### Boxing gloves
are gloves with some kind of pad
over and around the fist, so that the
wearer does not damage his or her hand,
and the person getting punched doesn’t
get cut.
Min ST: 1 W: 5 lbs Dmg: 1d4 + MD Rng: 1
AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Plated Boxing Gloves
Value: 300
Where one finds practitioners
of "the sweet science," one
finds
cheaters
as
well.
Someone
"accidentally"
put
metal plates into these boxing gloves.
Min ST: 1 W: 10 lbs Dmg: (1d4+5) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Punch Dagger
Value: 300
The punch dagger certainly isn’t a
subtle weapon; it is a large, serrated
combat
knife
attached
to
a
glove,
combining the force of a punch with the
tearing action of a toothed blade.
Expect to get kicked out of the boxing
ring for using this unorthodox piece of
equipment.
Min. ST: 1 W: 4 lbs. Dmg: (1d10+2) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 3 T:4 B: N/A
#### Punch Gun
Value: 600
This unusual weapon is a glove with a
trigger in the thumb, allowing the user
to fire a single shotgun shell at the
same time a punch is thrown. The damage
from the shotgun ammo is added to the
effects of the punch and melee damage.
Although they are somewhat awkward, as
the must be reloaded after every use, an
enterprising individual could do quite
well with one of these tools during a
surprise attack.
The punch gun holds 1
shotgun shell. Note that the incredibly
short barrel on the gun renders this
weapon
ineffective
at
all
but
the
closest ranges.
Min. ST: 2 W: 7 lbs. Dmg: (1d4 + Ammo) +
MD) Rng: 1 AP S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
#### Impact Glove
Value: 900
A Brotherhood of Steel invention, the
impact glove uses a unique piston device
similar to ones used by the much more
powerful Big Frigger line of power
fists.
The difference is that the
impact glove uses a smaller energy cell
that does not need to be recharged, and
is significantly less powerful.
It is
still a decent weapon, and can enhance
anyone’s
hand-to-hand
fighting
experience.
Min. ST: 1 w: 9 lbs. Dmg: (1d10+8) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
#### Adamantine Claws
Value: 1000
Named not because they are made from a
mystical
alloy,
but
because
they
resemble the claws of a 20th Century
comic-book
character,
these
gloves
feature
extendible
blades
that
are
designed to slash and
disembowel
even
the
strongest
critters.
The
user
can
control the claws’ action through a
trigger in the glove.
Min. ST: 2 W: 3 lbs Dmg: (1d10+5) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Power Fist
Value: 1800
The
"Big
Frigger"
Power
Fist
from
BeatCo.
Considered by many to be the
ultimate
weapon
to
use
in
unarmed
combat.
A Power Fist is a
metal glove that fits over the
hand and uses small motors to
enhance the power of a punch.
It holds 25 charges, and uses
Small
Energy
Cells
to
recharge.
The glove will “sense” when
the
user
throws
a
punch
and
automatically
adjusts
for
greater
damage, using energy even if the punch
doesn’t connect.
Min. ST: 1 W: 10 lbs. Dmg: (2d8+10) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
#### Mega Power Fist
Value: 2200
A more powerful version of the "Big
Frigger."
This one has upgraded power
servos for increased strength. The Mega
Power Fist holds 25 charges of
Small Energy Cells.
Like the
smaller version, it uses a
charge every time a punch is
thrown, even if it doesn’t
connect.
Min. ST: 1 W: 10 lbs. Dmg: (3d10+20) +
MD Rng: 1 AP S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
### Melee Skill Weapons
These weapons are held in the hand
and make contact with whatever
their user is trying to damage.
#### Rock
Value: N/A
Your basic, run of the mill rock.
There are only several trillion of
them lying around the wastes.
See also Throwing Weapons.
Min. ST: 1 W: 1 lb. Dmg: 1d4 +
MD Rng: 1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Sap
Value: 1
A sap is a simple weapon
designed
to
knock
someone
unconscious.
It is usually
just a rock or some packed
sand inside of an old tube of
cloth, like a sock.
Saps do
not actually damage a target,
and are only effective when targeting
someone’s head (treat this as a targeted
shot to the eyes).
A successful hit
causes the target to lose consciousness
for 1d10 rounds.
Min ST: 5 W: 1 lb. Dmg: None Rng: 1 AP
S: N/A T: 5 B: N/A
#### Shiv
Value: 2
A homemade knife that resembles an ice
pick.
A shiv is undetectable if your
character
is
holding
it;
however, it does not get a
bonus
for
melee
damage.
Shivs can be constructed from
the simplest of materials,
are often used as basic assassination
weapons, as they can be jabbed into an
ear of an unsuspecting target to cause
nearly instant death.
Min. ST: 1 W: 1 lb Dmg: 1d4 Rng: 1 AP S:
3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Broken Bottle
Value: 2
The weapon of choice for barfights,
broken bottles will do in a pinch when
the bouncer took your guns and you just
took some large raider’s girlfriend.
Contrary to popular belief, smashing a
bottle on the bar to break it won’t give
you a handy weapon. Instead, it’ll tear
holes in your hand. You’ll just have to
pick one of these up off the floor.
Min. ST: 1 W: 1 lb. Dmg: 1d6 + MD AP S:
3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Sharpened Pole
Value: 5
A basic piece of wood with a sharpened
end, about 2 meters
long.
See also
Throwing Weapons.
Min. ST: 3 W: 3 lbs. Dmg: (1d4+1) + MD
Rng: 2 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Metal Pipe
Value: 10
Either iron or lead, this old section of
plumbing makes a fine tool for breaking
bones and beating heads. Although heavy
and somewhat awkward, a piece of pipe
hurts just as badly as a club. Colonel
Mustard agrees.
Min. ST: 5 W: 10 lbs. Dmg: 1d10 + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 5 T: 5 B: N/A
#### Wooden Club
Value: 10
Humans have used these tools to kill
prey and bash each
other since we came
down from the trees.
It is nothing more
than
a
stick
with
some sharp points on it, or maybe a
rusty nail or two driven through it to
cause more pain and suffering to anyone
unlucky enough to get hit with it.
Chair legs, wooden sticks, pool cues,
and other wooden implements that might
be
lying
around
can
easily
be
substituted as a club in a pinch.
Min. ST: 3 W: 5 lbs. Dmg: 1d8 + MD Rng:
1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Club
Value: 30
A police-issue club used for subduing
criminals, or making sure they never
commit a crime again.
This weapon is
about 70 cm long and made
out of a rod of metal, with
a handle perpendicular to
the shaft, allowing the vibrations from
contact to diffuse before they travel up
the user’s arm.
A relatively easy
weapon to make from pieces of scrap
metal.
Min. ST: 3 W: 3 lbs. Dmg: 1d10 + MD Rng:
1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Shovel

Can you dig this, daddy-o?
Min. ST: 5 W: 15 lbs. Dmg: 1d12 + MD
Rng: 2 AP S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
#### Knife
Value: 40
A basic knife for cutting things.
Or
critters. Or people. See also Throwing
Weapons.
Knives are about
15-25 cm long.
The best
are made from metal alloys;
the most primitive are carved from
pieces of rock such as flint.
Min. ST: 2 W: 1 lb. Dmg 1d10 + MD Rng: 1
AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Claw Hammer
Value: 40
Either way you use this tool, it’s bound
to cause some pain and damage.
Also
useful for non-combative purposes.
Min. ST: 2 W: 4 lbs. Dmg: 1d10 + MD Rng:
1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Ax
Value: 45
This is a basic hatchet. Good for
breaking down wooden doors, or
sinking into that nuke pooch.
Another common weapon that can be
constructed from a piece of wood
and any hunk of sharp metal or
rock, axes are anywhere from 30 cm
to 90 cm in length.
Min. ST: 3 W: 2 lbs. Dmg: 1d8+MD Rng: 1
AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Switchblade
Value: 50
The blade of this small knife is held by
a spring. When a button on the
handle is pressed, the blade
shoots out with a satisfying
"Sssshk" sound.
Constructing
one of these takes some skill with both
metalworking and machinery, and they are
usually found in the possession of gangs
in larger cities.
Min. ST: 1 W: 1 lb. Dmg: 1d6 + MD Rng: 1
AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Wrench
Value: 65
This is probably far more useful for
repairing things, unless you are Col.
Mustard and happen to be
standing
in
the
Dining
Room.
Wrenches are pieces
of solid metal that can
double
as
clubs.
The
wrenches that are effective in combat
are anywhere from 40 to 80 cm in length.
See also Equipment.
Min. ST: 3 W: 4 lbs. Dmg: (1d6+2) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
#### Crowbar
Value: 65
A very solid and heavy piece of metal
specially designed to exert
leverage - or pound heads.
Crowbars are fashioned from a
piece of solid metal, twisted
so that the user can exert
force on an object and pry it upwards.
They are usually about 35 cm in length.
Min. ST: 5 W: 5 lbs. Dmg: (1d12+3) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
#### Spear
Value: 80
Your basic polearm.
A wooden pole with
a sharpened piece of metal on the end.
See also Throwing
Weapons.
Spears
are simple weapons
to construct, being a long (2 meter)
wooden pole with some kind of metal or
stone head tied to one end.
Min. ST: 4 W: 4 lbs. Dmg: (1d12+3) + MD
Rng: 2 AP S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
#### Machete
Value: 100
Hack your way through all manner of
flora and fauna with
this handy gardening
implement. The weapon
of
choice
for
the
intrepid
jungle
explorer, or the novice backyard weed-
whacker.
Min. ST: 4 W: 1 lb. Dmg: (1d10+7) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
#### Butcher’s Cleaver
Value: 110
This
kitchen
implement
was specifically designed
and balanced to ease the
task of cutting meat off
of
living
or
dead
creatures.
Made of a rust-resistant
graphite compound, this weapon stays
sharp longer and hacks harder than the
common knife.
Min. ST: 4 W: 1 lbs. Dmg: (1d8+10) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Sledgehammer
Value: 120
A pole with a heavy metal chunk on the
end,
designed
to
crumble
bones
and
damage vital organs.
Sledgehammers
are
about 70 cm long, and
require two hands to use properly..
Min. ST: 6 W: 12 lbs. Dmg: 3d4 + MD Rng:
2 AP S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
#### Scalpel
Value: 140
The standard instrument for performing
surgeries, this surgical-stainless steel
knife
is
small
but
incredibly sharp.
Not
the best tool for a
melee fight, but it
will do in a pinch. See also Equipment.
Min. ST: 1 W: 1 lb. Dmg: (1d8+3) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Combat Knife
Value: 165
A military-issued knife designed for
melee combat.
The serrated edges tend
to tear instead of cut, and
wounds from this blade are
a lot more painful than
normal knife wounds.
See
also Throwing Weapons.
Combat knives
were constructed from a carbon-based
compound instead of a metal, making them
more durable, less prone to dulling, and
lighter than a normal knife.
They are
usually 15 to 25 cm long.
Min. ST: 2 W: 2 lbs. Dmg: (1d12+3) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Wakizashi Blade
Value: 200
A futuristic RPG would not be complete
without the Yakuza (Japanese mafia) and
the Fallout universe is no exception.
In fact, the only way a non-
Yakuza member will get one of
these swords is to take it
off the body of a Yakuza. The
Wakizashi looks like a smaller Katana.
Because these blades are so difficult to
make, it is highly doubtful that anyone
makes these weapons in the wastes, and
they
are
most
likely
tourist-store
ripoffs from pre-War times.
Of course,
there
are
always
exceptions.
The
Wakizashi is about 60 cm long, and
slightly curved.
Min ST: 2 W: 2 lbs. Dmg: (1d12+4) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Louisville Slugger
Value: 300
This all-American, hardwood baseball bat

aluminum ripoffs.
Min. ST: 4 W: 4 lbs. Dmg:
2d10+ MD Rng: 1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Micro Sledgehammer
Value: 500
A Brotherhood of Steel specialty, the
Micro Sledgehammer is the dream of any
child who ever wanted to misuse a
croquet mallet.
Originally designed to
make construction more efficient, the
Brotherhood’s piston technology means
this small sledge hits with maximum
effect.
Min. ST: 4 W: 8 lbs. Dmg: (1d12+8) + MD
Rng: 1 AP: S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Cattle Prod
Value: 600
Since this weapon is designed to knock a
cow unconscious, imagine what it can do
to a human.
The cattle prod looks a
little like an overgrown
tuning fork, except that an
arc of electricity passes
between the prongs on the
end
whenever
the
user
presses the button.
Any biological
critter hit with a cattle prod has a 50%
chance of being knocked unconscious.
Each time an attack is made, successful
or not, the Prod uses one charge.
The
Cattle Prod holds 25 charges of Small
Energy Cell.
Min. ST: 4 W: 5 lbs. Dmg: (2d6+10) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
#### Ripper
Value: 1000
Basically
a
knife-sized
chainsaw,
without the noisy motor.
Rippers were
common
among
gangs
and
thugs before the war, and
are common among criminals
and lowlifes after the war.
It's called a ripper for a reason; it
tears flesh and organs to pieces. Every
time an attack is made, successful or
not, the Ripper uses one charge.
The
Ripper holds 25 charges of Small Energy
Cell.
Min. ST: 4 W: 5 lbs. Dmg: (1d10+15) + MD
Rng: 1 S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
#### Super Cattle Prod
Value: 1800
An upgraded cattle prod. Any biological
critter hit with this
tool has a 75% chance
of
being
knocked
unconscious.
The
Super
Cattle
Prod
requires two hands to use.
Every time
an attack is made, regardless of the
attack’s success, the Super Prod uses
one charge.
This weapon holds 25
charges of Small Energy Cell.
Min. ST: 4 W: 5 lbs Dmg: (2d8+20) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
#### Garrote
Value: 2000
This weapon is an unusual weapon
favored by assassins and Yakuza.
It is
a razor-sharp, super thin, extra-strong
wire strung between two handles.
Min. ST: 1 W: 1 lb. Dmg: (4d10) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
#### Chainsaw
Value: 3000
A leftover from the pre-War days, a
chainsaw is probably the ultimate melee
weapon.
Although it
runs
on
gasoline,
surely there must be
a tank or two of
ethanol left in the
wastes somewhere.
A
character could graft
one of these to an
arm for some added fun.
Min. ST: 4 W: 10 lbs. Dmg (3d10+20) + MD
Rng: 1 AP S: 5 T: N/A B: N/A
#### Proton Ax
Value: 3500
The proton ax is a nasty
little tool.
A double-
bladed ax, much like what
Gimli the Dwarf would be
wielding,
covered
with
depleted Uranium, allowing
it to pass through almost
anything. Proton Axes are
made exclusively by the Guardians, and
are very rare.
They are about 150 cm
from handle to tip and the axhead is 50
cm long and almost 80 cm across.
Min. ST: 5 W: 15 lbs. Dmg: (3d10+10) +
MD Rng: 1 AP S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
#### Super Sledgehammer
Value: 3750
The Super Sledgehammer is manufactured
exclusively by the
Brotherhood of Steel
using
the
finest
weapons
technology
available.
At first
glance, this nifty
little tool is indistinguishable from a
regular sledgehammer, except for the
small bundle of machinery at the base of
the head.
It includes a kinetic energy
storage device to increase knock back.
The Super Sledge is a two-handed weapon.

### Guns Skill Weapons
#### Primitive Missile Weapons
One of the oldest “firearms” is the
bow. Traces of these weapons have
been found among excavations of the
most primitive settlements, and
Neanderthals used them over 30,000 years
ago. The bow family of weapons is
suddenly very popular in a world where
they are easy to make and are better
than a knife or sharpened stick. Bows
all require two hands to use.
Other kinds of primitive missile weapons
are popular among tribals again as well,
as they are far easier to construct and
maintain than 100-year-old firearms.
###### Sling
Value: 20
Not a bow, but a similar ancient weapon,
slings have been around
almost as long. A
leather pouch attached
to some long leather
cords, slings are
designed to hurl rocks
farther and more accurately than one can
do by hand. The user spins the sling
around in the air, gathering momentum,
and then flicks his or her wrist to
release the rock at the target. Note
that slings do not require two hands to
use. Single shot only. Slings hold one
rock.
Min. ST: 5 W: 2 lbs. Dmg: 1d10 Rng: 10
S: 5 T: 6 B: N/A
###### Blowgun
Value: 30
A blowgun is a hollow tube that the user
blows a strong burst of air through,
launching a
small,
feathered dart
at an enemy. They can be made from
anything hollow, including old metal
pipes, reeds, and drinking straws. The
darts that a blowgun fires don’t do an
extraordinary amount of damage, but many
are coated with poisons. A favorite
weapon of assassins, since it makes very
little noise. A blowgun holds 1 blowgun
dart.
Min. ST: 1 W: 1 lb. Dmg: +0 Rng: 20 AP
A: 3 T: 4 B: N/A
###### Wooden Bow
Value: 50
Made from a cut piece of wood, bent into
a “C” shape, with a length of string or
animal sinew stretched between the
ends to provide tension, bows are
some of the simplest ranged weapons
to construct. They can be
unwieldy, however, and can hurt the
inexperienced user. Single shot
only. Bows hold one arrow.
Min. ST: 5 W: 2 lbs. DMG: +3 Rng:
40 AP S: 5 T: 6 B: N/A
###### Wooden Crossbow
Value: 300
Crossbows were part of every army on
earth from their invention in the late
middle ages until the First World War.
After that, they became popular hunting
weapons. Crossbows are wooden bows laid
across a plank or
flat surface, or even
the stock of a rifle.
They have a wheel
that winds the string
tight, and a trigger
mechanism that
releases tension on the string, shooting
the bolt at high velocity. Because the
tension on the string is no longer
limited by human strength, crossbows can
shoot projectiles much farther, and with
a far greater degree of accuracy, than a
bow. Single shot only. Crossbows hold
one bolt.
Min. ST: 4 W: 10 lbs. DMG: +4 Rng: 50 AP
S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
###### Composite Hunting Bow
Value: 600
This pre-War relic can still
be found in some parts of the
wastes. A system of wheels
and a longer string was
added, and the bow
constructed from a carbon
compound, adding accuracy and
distance. Single shot only.
Composite hunting bows hold
one arrow.
Min. ST: 5 W: 8 lbs. DMG: +5 Rng: 60 AP
S: 5 T: 6 B: N/A
###### Composite Hunting Crossbow
Value: 900
These were rare before
the war, and are even
harder to find now.
Composite hunting
crossbows work on the
same principles
composite bows do.
Composite crossbows hold one bolt.
Min. ST: 4 W: 12 lbs. DMG: +6 Rng: 70 AP
S: 4 T: 5 B: N/A
#### Pistols
The smallest of the ballistic weapons,
pistols
are

###### Silenced .22 Pistol
Value: 300
Produced in the 20th Century as an
inexpensive solution to gun ownership,
the tiny .22 pistol fires the relatively
small .22 caliber slug.
These guns
simply don’t have the stopping power of
larger pistols, and a shot from one is
more likely to upset the target than
cause massive amounts of damage. Single
shot only. The clip holds 10 rounds of
.22 caliber ammunition.

The
.38
Special
was
the
longtime
favorite of police forces until the
advent of newer automatic weapons.
It
has existed in one form or
another since the early 20th
century,
and
although
different
companies
manufactured it, the .38 Special is one
of the most universal guns available.
The
short
barrel
length
makes
it
ineffective except for very close range
combat. Single shot only. The revolver

Although not as powerful as its big
brother, the .357 sports a longer barrel

prewar tech, the Needler pistol actually
fires
small
hypodermic

slightly
misconceived

Although relatively ineffectual as a sub
machinegun, the Scorpio VZ61 nonetheless
enjoys a place among assassins and

for its lack of power,
range,

Praised for its range and stopping
power, the PPK-12 Gauss Pistol is of
German design. This "Lil' Railgun" uses
an electromagnetic field to propel slugs
at tremendous speed and power
through a target, any armor,
and
just
about
everything
else. The PPK-12 looks like a
normal automatic pistol, except for the
unusual electromagnetic fins along the

#### Shotguns
Shotguns use 12-guage ammunition and usually fire buckshot as opposed to a single bullet.
They hurt a lot.
They look a bit like rifles, and often take two hands to fire correctly.
Shotguns fire either buckshot or slugs;
buckshot is a shell full of little metal balls that isn’t as accurate as a
bullet, because the balls will begin to come apart in flight, and shells are
large slugs, designed for hitting things as longer ranges and hurting them more
than a pistol does.
Note that
using slug ammunition in a shotgun increases the range by 5 hexes, and
firing a double shot (both barrels)
decreases range by 3 hexes.

The
Winchester
"Widowmaker"
double-

#### Submachine Guns
SMGs can fire single shots as well
as bursts of bullets.
Submachine
guns were designed to put the
stopping and suppressive power of early
machine guns like the Gatling gun into
the hands of infantry soldiers. Used as
early as late World War I, submachine
guns soon changed the face or warfare in
the
20th
century.

most
submachine guns are small enough to use
as one-handed weapons.

tending
to
overheat
in
fully automatic fire. This

Value: 1200
Originally designed for the Israeli
armies, Uzis found their way into the
hands of many terrorist organizations.

The "Tommy Gun" submachine gun is a
sinister looking weapon.
When your
character holds this gun, he or she
experiences
a
strange sensation to
wear a fedora hat
and crack his or her
knuckles.
Originally
designed
by
General John Thompson during the first
World War, the Tommy Gun became the
staple of law enforcement officers as
well as organized crime and the IRA.
Instead of a clip, the Thompson loads
its unusual .45 caliber ammunition from
a drum under the barrel. Note that the
Thompson must be used as a two-handed
weapon.
The Tommy Gun fires single
shots or up to a 10-shot burst.

The "Grease Gun" filled National Guard
armories after the Army replaced it with
newer

###### Spear Gun
Value: 1400
Before the war, these strange guns were
used to hunt for fish and other game.
Because the mechanism relies only on
tension to operate, and the special
spears fired from
these weapons are
relatively
easy
to make, they are
very popular in
lower-technology

###### SVD-4000
Value: 2400
The SVD-4000 was the precursor to the
PSG1, and is a fine weapon in its own
right.
Unfortunately, a design flaw
rendered a great deal
of
these
guns
inoperable,
so
a
working version can usually only be
found
in
the
hands
of
a
serious
collector.
Because of the flaw, these
guns were never widely issued to armed
forces in the developed world.
Single

handed weapons.
###### M14
Value: 1000
The first assault rifle issued to the
United States Armed
Forces
before
the
Second
World
War,
the
M14
was
the
predecessor
to
the
legendary

The older rifle in the AK line, the AK-
47 is possible the most famous, most
reliable, and best-built assault rifle
ever.
Originally used by the Soviets
and their Warsaw Pact allies, the AK-47
was copied by manufacturers in almost
every
country
on
earth.
These

Value: 1600
A tweak on the Soviet-
era AK series, the AK-
74 is also known as the

They
all
require two hands to use, and many of
them need a tripod for any degree of
accuracy.
###### Browning M2 Minigun
Value: 3000
Originally
designed
as
a
tripod-mounted
weapon in the last
stages of World War
I, the Browning was
later adapted for infantry use as the
first true minigun.
The fact that it
uses a belt makes it somewhat awkward,
and the weight makes it unwieldy if not
fired from a stand. These guns were so
well made that many were serviceable 100
years after manufacture.
The M2 was
horded by survivalists before the War.
Fires a 10-shot burst only.

###### Light Support Weapon
Value: 4750
This
squad-level
support weapon has
a bullpup design,
making it difficult
to use while lying down.
Because of
this it was remanded to National Guard
units.
However, it earned a reputation
as a reliable weapon that packs a lot of
punch for its size. The LSW gains some
accuracy when attached to a tripod. The

Value: 5250
The Bozar is the ultimate refinement of
the sniper’s art.
Although somewhat
finicky and prone to jamming if not kept
scrupulously
clean,
the
big

BMG
ammunition;
bullets
designed to pierce the
armor of tanks and to
down helicopters.
It
can only be fired from a tripod because
of its extreme kickback.

in the last days of the War, the MEC
Gauss Minigun is an experimental weapon
of
great
destruction.
Only
the
strongest soldiers could
wield
and
control
this
mighty
weapon,
and
it
usually did so much damage that the
Chinese questioned the ethics involved
in issuing such a device to battlefield
troops.
The MEC’s shots have the
telltale spiral of ionized gas that is
the trademark of other railguns.
The
MEC fires a 20 round burst only.

#### Grenade Launchers and Mortars
Grenade
launchers
sling
small
explosive
rounds
at
a
target.
Often, they look a good deal like
rifles, or even machineguns.
Mortars
fire
explosive
ordinance
over
much
longer ranges.
They are usually just
tubes with a firing mechanism attached.
Mortars aren’t suitable for close-range
combat, as they explode over a wide
area, and are primarily used for long-
range (.5 KM or more) combat between
squads and light vehicles.
There are
several types of grenades and mortar
ordinance available to shoot; for more
details, see the Ammunition section.
Note that grenades and mortars cannot be
targeted.
Ranges for mortars are given
in KM, and damage is discussed under the
different kinds of Ammunition for these
devices

Grenade
launchers and personal mortars take two
hands to use.
###### BG-1 Grenade Launcher

F
lamethrowers
are
fairly
self-
explanatory; they fire a high-
temperature substance called fire
at
targets
to
damage
said
target.
Flamethrowers can also be re-fitted with
different kinds of ammunition tanks, so
they can shoot things other than fire.
Very, very nasty things.
It goes
without saying that flamethrowers are
two-handed weapons.
###### M9E1-7 Flamethrower
Value: 2000
Your
basic
flamethrower. A
nozzle
with
a
gun-like trigger
is attached to a
hose which is in turn attached to a
special
backpack
containing
fuel.
Useful for taking out large groups of
people. Flamethrower fuel is not always
the only thing a flamethrower can spew.
For

about
damage
from
flamethrowers and fire, see the Non-
Conventional

### Energy Weapons Skill Weapons
E
nergy weapons were developed in the
early 21st century, and almost every
major government employed them in
their armed forces at the time of the
war.
Pistols do not require two hands
to use, all other energy weapons do.
There are two main kinds of energy
weapons: laser and plasma.
Lasers are
highly concentrated beams of light that
melt
through
pretty
much
anything.
Plasma is superheated, ionized gas that
melts through pretty much anything.
There are other kinds of energy weapons
as well.
Note that damage from energy
weapons is weapon-dependant, not ammo-
dependant.
Energy pistols are one-
handed weapons, but energy rifles and
big energy weapons require two hands.
#### Energy Pistols
T
he simplest energy weapons, and
usually the weakest, are energy pistols.
They
are
however,
good
for
concealing and scaring people who have
not dealt with energy weapons before.
###### Wattz 1000 Laser Pistol
Value: 1200
The civilian model of the W-1600 laser pistol,
The W-1000 is slightly weaker and has a
shorter range. There are still a few of
these lying around the wastes, although
they tend to be in pretty bad shape.
The W-1000 holds 10 charges, and uses
Small Energy Cells to recharge.

###### Wattz 1600 Laser Pistol
Value: 1400
The Laser Pistol is perhaps
the simplest of the energy
weapons.
It
fires
concentrated
light
at
a
target, exciting the molecules at the
point of impact and causing considerable
damage.
Favored
by
assassins
and
gangsters because of its relatively
inexpensive
price
and
small
size.
Single shot only.
The Laser Pistol
holds 12 charges, and uses the Small

###### Solar Scorcher
Value: 2000
The Solar Scorcher is not
named
because
it
can
actually damage the sun,
but instead of ammo it
uses
the
sun’s
rays
to
recharge.
Unfortunately, this makes its use in
caves, buildings, and at night somewhat
limited.
It recharges in about 30
seconds, but must be in direct sunlight
to do so. Single shot only. The Solar
Scorcher holds 6 charges, and uses
direct sunlight to recharge.

###### Spasm Gun
Value: 2200
An adaptation of a stun gun, a small
personal defense tool,
the spasm gun is an
energy
weapon
that
fires an electric burst
at
a
target,
overwhelming
the
target’s nervous system and rendering
them immobile as well as causing massive
internal damage.
And target hit with
the spasm gun will be unconscious for

developmental
stage
at
the
beginning of the war, and are very
rare.
These are, without a doubt, the
most valuable weapons in the wastes.
###### Gatling Laser
Value: 7500
The H&K L30 Gatling Laser is the only

###### Ion Beamer
Value: 14000
This was an experimental weapon at the
beginning of the war.
Kind of awkward,
as it looks a good
deal
like
the
Ghostbusters’
proton
packs, the Ion Beamer
is
a
subatomic
particle-spewing hose
attached to a backpack
with a nuclear accelerator.
The Ion
Beamer showers a target with skin-
damaging ionized gas.
The ions cause
the atoms in the target’s body to start
losing or gaining electrons, eventually
leading to the target’s disintegration.
Note that the Ion Beamer cannot be
targeted.

Another experimental weapon, the MESON
Cannon is a shoulder-fired weapon of
incredible destructive power. It shoots
MESONs, which are made
up of two quarks – a
quark
and
an
antiquark.
Since
normal
protons
are
made up of three quarks, the addition of
a MESON into a normal proton causes the
atom to begin exploding at close to the
speed of light, leaving nothing but
quarks.
Note that the MESON Cannon
cannot be targeted.
Single shot only.
The MESON Cannon holds 10 charges, and
uses Micro Fusion Cells to recharge.

constructed
from
anything from wood to plastic to metal,
a dart is a tiny object thrown into the
flesh of a target.
They aren’t known
for causing excessive amounts of damage,
but
when
coated
with
the
right
substance, darts make a great poisoner’s
weapon.

#### Bola
Value: 10
Originally
designed
by
native peoples in Europe
and
the
Americas,
and
adopted as recently as 100
years ago by ranchers in
Argentina, a bola is a
rope with two or three rocks tied to the
ends.
One uses a bola by swinging it
over their head and tossing it at the
target; if successful, the bola will
wrap around the target, knocking it off
its feet and rendering it immobile.
Bolas do not actually do damage, but are
a favorite weapon of slavers who do not
wish their goods harmed.
Anything hit
with a bola is automatically knocked
down
and
immobile
until
freed;
a
successful roll against Strength allows
the target to break out.

Value: 15
Although
boomerangs
are
commonly
associated
with
Australian
aborigines,
similar devices have been found among
indigenous
peoples
the

over.
Contrary to popular belief, hunting
boomerangs (the kind that hurt) do not
return to the user. They are a cleverly
designed wooden airfoil with a handle on
one end, and can cause a surprising
amount of damage for their relative
size.

The
smoke
grenade
doesn’t
actually
explode, but a chemical reaction causes
a cloud of smoke to be released in a

#### Phantasm (Fantasy) Ball
Value: 200
At first glance, this appears to be a
solid metal sphere about the size of a
baseball. When enough centrifugal force
is applied – say, from throwing it or
rolling it on the ground – metal spikes
pop out of the ball, turning it into a
sharp, deadly object.
Its damage is
relatively low, so phantasm balls are
best used in conjunction with poison, as
an assassin’s tool, or as a caltrop to
cause damage to a car tire.
